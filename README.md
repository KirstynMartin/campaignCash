# campaignCash
D3.js bubble chart experimentation in order to learn more about data visualization.

The purpose of Campaign Cash was to generate awareness around the ballot propositions for the November 2016 election. I intended the project to be abstract, vibrant, and interesting to interact with. The purpose of the site is to get millennials interested in learning more about the ballot initiatives affecting their lives and casting an educated vote in November.
